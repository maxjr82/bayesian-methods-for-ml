# Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning ðŸŽ“

This is a repository for the notebooks provided in the Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning course, which 
is offered by the National Research University Higher School of Economics through the Coursera platform.

The basics of Bayesian methods is discussed in this online HSE course, including how to define a probabilistic 
model and make predictions from it. Techniques for automating and accelerating this workflow is also be covered.
Applications of Bayesian methods to deep learning and generating new images are be demonstrated, as well as how 
these methods can be used to discover new drugs for treating severe diseases.
